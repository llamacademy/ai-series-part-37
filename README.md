# Navmesh AI Tutorial 37 - NavMeshAgents Avoiding and Breaking Obstructions

In this tutorial repository and [accompanying video](https://youtu.be/fBu4_psgTXs) you will learn how to make your NavMeshAgents break down obstacles that block their path. 
The agents will consider if a particular path is worth going through by breaking down the obstructions or if pathing around them is more worthwhile.

This is done through some trickery on the NavMesh and a State Machine on the Enemy.

This _is_ a more advanced tutorial that expects you are already familiar with some other concepts. 
See the below links for more in-depth explanations of those topics:
